# AbstractDataTypeLibrary
Library that contains several abstract data types implemented in C#, along with their unit tests:

* ArrayList
* LinkedList
* Set
* B-Tree
* Queue
* Stack
* ...

In addition to that, some sorting algorithms are implemented:

* Bubble sort
* Merge sort
* Selection sort
* Insert sort
* Quick sort
 

This project was born as a Kata exercise in .NET, to test TDD and some basic algorithm.
